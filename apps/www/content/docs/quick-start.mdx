This guide will help you get a basic instance of Drivebase up and running as quickly as possible using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Fast Docker Run

The fastest way to get started is with our automated installer:

```bash
wget -qO- https://drivebase.one/install | bash
```

This will create a `drivebase` folder, set up your configuration, and generate secure keys automatically.

Alternatively, you can follow the manual steps below:

1. **Download the Production Compose file**:
   ```bash
   wget -O compose.yaml https://drivebase.one/compose
   # OR: curl -o compose.yaml https://drivebase.one/compose
   ```

2. **Create an environment file**:
   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```

3. **Add basic configuration**:
   Open `.env.local` and add the following (replace with your own secrets):
   ```dotenv
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/drivebase
   REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
   JWT_SECRET=super-secret-jwt-key
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-character-long-encryption-key-!!
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
   *Note: For production, use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate secure keys.*

4. **Start the services**:
   Run the following command to start Drivebase and its dependencies:
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.local up -d
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - Web App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - GraphQL Playground: [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)

## First Login

When you first access Drivebase, you will need to create an owner account.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/register`.
2. Enter your email and a strong password.
3. Once registered, you will be logged in as the system owner.

## Connect Your First Provider

To start managing files, you need to connect a storage provider.

1. Go to the **Providers** section in the sidebar.
2. Click **Connect Provider**.
3. Choose **Local Storage** for a quick test.
4. Give it a name (e.g., "My Local Disk") and specify a path inside the container (e.g., `/data/storage`).
5. Click **Connect**.

Now you can go to the **Files** section and start uploading!
