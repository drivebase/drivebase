Drivebase AI helps you find files faster by understanding file content, not only file names.

## What AI does

AI can:

- Read text from documents and images.
- Detect common objects in images.
- Support smarter search using keywords, natural language, and concepts.

You can search by:

- File name
- Text inside files
- Related meaning (semantic search)
- Detected objects in images

## Supported file types

- PDF files
- Text files (`txt`, `json`, `csv`)
- DOCX files
- Images

## Model sizes

You can choose model sizes for each AI category:

- Lightweight: lower resource usage, faster
- Medium: balanced performance and quality
- Heavy: higher quality, more resource usage

## AI features you can control

- Embeddings (semantic understanding)
- OCR / text extraction
- Object detection

## Progress and reliability

AI processing runs in the background so uploads are not blocked.

You can:

- Start and stop processing
- Retry failed files
- Watch realtime progress in Settings

## Current limits

AI works well for common search and content lookup. Very specific visual attribute queries may require additional specialized vision models.
