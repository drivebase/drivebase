## No results from PDF content

Possible causes:

- OCR is disabled
- Required models are not downloaded
- File analysis failed
- File was not processed

What to do:

1. Confirm OCR is enabled.
2. Confirm required models show **Downloaded**.
3. Start processing or retry failed files.
4. Check Progress counts for failures.

## Models appear unavailable after switching workspace

Model files are global, but each workspace validates readiness for its selected model tiers.

What to do:

- Ensure selected tiers match downloaded models.
- Re-open AI settings to refresh readiness.

## Processing stays at 0%

Possible causes:

- AI processing is disabled
- No eligible files
- Worker or inference service is unreachable
- Missing inference runtime dependencies

What to do:

1. Confirm AI Processing is ON.
2. Confirm model downloads are complete.
3. Confirm inference service is running.
4. Retry failed files.

## Image OCR not working

Possible causes:

- OCR disabled
- OCR dependencies missing in runtime

What to do:

- Enable OCR in AI Processing.
- Verify inference runtime dependencies are installed.

## Object search quality is weak

Possible causes:

- Object detection disabled
- Object model not downloaded
- Files not reprocessed after changes

What to do:

1. Enable object detection.
2. Download object detection model.
3. Re-run processing.

## Results look noisy or irrelevant

Possible causes:

- Query is too short
- Extraction data is missing for target files
- Model and feature setup mismatch

What to do:

- Use slightly longer, clearer queries.
- Confirm extraction features are enabled.
- Retry failed files.

## Reset path

If setup gets out of sync:

1. Delete AI data.
2. Verify feature toggles.
3. Download required models.
4. Start processing again.
