## Common Features

All storage providers in Drivebase support the following core features:

### Automatic Syncing
Drivebase periodically syncs with your connected providers to ensure that metadata (file names, sizes, etc.) is up to date. You can also trigger a manual sync at any time from the provider settings.

### Quota Management
Monitor how much storage you are using across different platforms from a single dashboard.

### Provider Security
Your provider credentials (API keys, secrets, tokens) are always encrypted at rest in the Drivebase database using the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` defined in your environment variables.
