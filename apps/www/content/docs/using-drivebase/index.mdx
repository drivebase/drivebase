description: Learn how to manage your files and folders in Drivebase
---

Drivebase provides a familiar, intuitive interface for managing your files across multiple storage backends.

## File Management

### Uploading Files
You can upload files by clicking the **Upload** button in any folder. When uploading, you may be asked to choose which storage provider to use if multiple are connected.

### Downloading Files
To download a file, click the download icon next to the file name or select **Download** from the file's context menu.

### Moving and Renaming
- **Rename**: Right-click a file or folder and select **Rename**.
- **Move**: Use the **Move** action to transfer files between folders. Note that moving a file between different storage providers is currently handled by Drivebase internally.

### Deleting Files
Deleting a file in Drivebase performs a **soft delete**. The file will be marked as deleted and will not appear in regular listings, but it may still exist on the remote provider until permanently purged.

## Folder Navigation

Drivebase uses a **Virtual Folder Structure**. This means you can create folders to organize your files regardless of which storage provider they are actually stored on.

- **Breadcrumbs**: Use the breadcrumbs at the top of the file list to navigate back up the folder hierarchy.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar provides quick access to the root folder, favorites, and recent files.

## Search and Favorites

### Searching
Use the search bar at the top of the interface to find files by name. Search results will include files from all connected providers.

### Favorites (Starred Items)
You can "Star" important files and folders for quick access. Starred items appear in the **Favorites** section in the sidebar.

## Managing Storage
In the **Providers** section, you can:
- See the total and used storage for each provider.
- Sync providers to ensure metadata is up to date.
- Manage individual provider settings.
