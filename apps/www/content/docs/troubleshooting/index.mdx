description: Solutions for common issues and errors in Drivebase
---

If you encounter issues while using Drivebase, this guide covers the most common problems and how to solve them.

## Connection Issues

### API Not Reachable
- **Symptom**: The web app shows "Unable to connect to API" or stays on a loading screen.
- **Fix**: 
    - Ensure the API server is running (`docker compose ps` or `bun run dev`).
    - Check that `VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL` in your frontend configuration matches the actual API URL.
    - Check for CORS errors in the browser console. Ensure `CORS_ORIGIN` in the API configuration allows your frontend domain.

### Database or Redis Connection
- **Symptom**: Logs show `Connection refused` or `Authentication failed` for PostgreSQL or Redis.
- **Fix**:
    - Verify that `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` are correct.
    - Ensure the database and Redis services are healthy and accessible from the API container.

## Authentication Issues

### Login Fails
- **Symptom**: "Invalid credentials" error even with correct email/password.
- **Fix**:
    - Ensure you have registered an account. If using the default owner bootstrap, verify the `DEFAULT_OWNER_EMAIL` and `DEFAULT_OWNER_PASSWORD` environment variables.
    - Check that `JWT_SECRET` is consistent across restarts. Changing it will invalidate all existing sessions.

### Session Expired
- **Symptom**: Suddenly logged out or receiving `UNAUTHENTICATED` errors.
- **Fix**: Refresh the page to re-authenticate. If the issue persists, check if the server time is synchronized.

## File Operations

### Upload Fails
- **Symptom**: Uploads get stuck at 0% or return a `500 Internal Server Error`.
- **Fix**:
    - Check the API logs for specific provider errors.
    - For S3: Verify bucket permissions and region settings.
    - For Local: Ensure the API has write permissions to the specified `rootPath`.
    - Check if the file size exceeds any limits set by your reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).

### CORS Errors on Direct Upload
- **Symptom**: Browser console shows CORS errors when uploading directly to S3 or Google Drive.
- **Fix**: Ensure your storage provider is configured to allow CORS from your Drivebase frontend URL.

## Logs

To get more detailed information about what's happening, check the application logs:

- **Docker**: `docker compose logs -f api`
- **Manual**: Check the console where `bun run dev` is running.

In development, logs are formatted with `pino-pretty` for readability. In production, they are standard JSON for easier parsing by log management tools.
