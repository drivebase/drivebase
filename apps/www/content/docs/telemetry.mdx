Drivebase collects **anonymous usage telemetry** to help understand how the product is used and to prioritize improvements. Telemetry is enabled by default and can be opted out at any time.

## What we collect

All events are tied to a randomly generated **instance ID** — a UUID created on first startup. It is not linked to any user account, email address, or identifiable information.

| Event | Data collected |
|---|---|
| `server_started` | App version, environment (`production`/`development`) |
| `server_shutdown` | _(none)_ |
| `user_registered` | Role (`owner`, `admin`, `member`) |
| `user_login` | Success or failure (boolean) |
| `onboarding_completed` | _(none)_ |
| `provider_connected` | Provider type (e.g. `google_drive`, `s3`) |
| `provider_disconnected` | Provider type |
| `provider_sync_completed` | Provider type, duration in ms |
| `provider_oauth_initiated` | Provider type |
| `file_uploaded` | Provider type, size bucket, vault flag |
| `file_downloaded` | Provider type |
| `file_deleted` | _(none)_ |
| `chunked_upload_completed` | Provider type, size bucket |
| `chunked_upload_failed` | Provider type, failure reason |
| `vault_setup` | _(none)_ |
| `file_rule_created` | _(none)_ |
| `workspace_created` | _(none)_ |
| `workspace_invite_accepted` | _(none)_ |

File size buckets are coarse ranges (`small` \<10 MB, `medium` \<50 MB, `large` \<200 MB, `chunked` ≥200 MB) — no exact sizes are sent.

## What we never collect

- File names, folder paths, or any file content
- User emails, names, or any personally identifiable information
- Provider credentials, API keys, or tokens
- IP addresses or geographic data
- Workspace names or member lists

## Instance ID

On first startup, Drivebase generates a random UUID and stores it in the data directory (`/app/data/.instance-id`). This ID persists across restarts via the `drivebase_data` Docker volume. It is not linked to any user or machine — it exists solely to deduplicate telemetry from a single instance.

## Telemetry provider

Telemetry data is sent to **PostHog** (US region, `https://us.i.posthog.com`). PostHog is an open-source analytics platform. No data is sold or shared with third parties.

## How to opt out

Set the `DRIVEBASE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `false`:

```dotenv
DRIVEBASE_TELEMETRY=false
```

Once set, no telemetry events will be captured or sent. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for where to add environment variables.
