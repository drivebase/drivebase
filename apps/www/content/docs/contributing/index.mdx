We welcome contributions to Drivebase! Whether you are fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Development Workflow

Drivebase is built as a monorepo using [Turbo](https://turbo.build/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drivebase/drivebase.git
   cd drivebase
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:
   Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`. You will need a running PostgreSQL and Redis instance.

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
   This starts the API and the web frontend in parallel with hot-reloading.

## Monorepo Structure

- `apps/api`: The GraphQL server built with Yoga and Bun.
- `apps/web`: The React frontend built with Vite.
- `apps/www`: This documentation site.
- `packages/core`: Shared types, enums, and base error classes.
- `packages/db`: Database schema (Drizzle ORM) and client.
- `packages/*-provider`: Implementation of different storage backends (S3, Google Drive, Local).

## Coding Standards

- **Formatting**: We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Run `bun biome check --write` before committing.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features. We use Bun's built-in test runner. Run `bun test`.
- **GraphQL**: If you modify the schema in `apps/api/graphql/schema`, remember to run `bun run codegen` to update generated types.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes and ensure tests pass.
3. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of the changes and the problem they solve.
4. Adhere to the existing code style and naming conventions.
