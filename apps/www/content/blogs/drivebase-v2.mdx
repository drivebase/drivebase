Drivebase v2.0.0 is now live.

This release focuses on three things: stronger security, faster day-to-day workflows, and better support for global teams. If you are already running Drivebase, v2 is the biggest step forward since launch.

## What is new in v2

### Vault in Drivebase v2

Vault in Drivebase v2 gives teams a dedicated encrypted workflow for sensitive content. Files are encrypted client-side, then proxied through the Drivebase API to the configured storage provider, so providers receive ciphertext rather than plaintext.

### Workspace export with encryption options

You can now export workspace data with encryption options built in. This gives teams a safer path for backup, migration, and compliance-driven operations.

### Smarter uploads and destination paths

Uploads now support destination path handling, making it easier to place files exactly where they belong from the start. We also added upload rules to improve consistency and reduce mistakes.

### New product pages and workflow surfaces

v2 adds dedicated pages for:

- Vault
- Smart Upload
- Cloud Transfers
- Team Collaboration

These pages are part of a broader effort to make key Drivebase workflows easier to discover and adopt.

### Built-in updater service

Drivebase now includes an updater service to make application updates more reliable and easier to operate over time.

### Recent Updates feed

A new recent updates feature now integrates with the API and includes loading-state support, so teams can track product changes directly inside the app.

### Commit message generation prompt

For development teams, v2 adds a commit message generation prompt to streamline routine git workflows.

## Team and admin improvements

This release also includes improvements that make larger deployments easier to manage:

- A separate users section
- Better invite expiration tab selection and settings input consistency
- Clearer onboarding and welcome-step copy

## Internationalization upgrades

Drivebase v2 significantly improves localization support:

- Arabic language support
- RTL layout support
- Migration to PO-based i18n format

This makes Drivebase more usable for multilingual and right-to-left teams.

## Stability and quality upgrades

Alongside features, v2 ships multiple fixes across the stack, including:

- Improved provider details in vault queries
- Better server shutdown handling
- Web i18n import cleanup
- Release pipeline and repository metadata fixes

These changes improve reliability, operational predictability, and release quality.

## Why v2 matters

Drivebase v2 is a practical upgrade for teams that care about:

- Secure file operations
- Better collaboration ergonomics
- Predictable updates and maintenance
- Global accessibility across languages and writing directions
