Drivebase can be installed in several ways depending on your needs. For most users, we recommend using Docker Compose with our pre-built image.

## Prerequisites

Regardless of the installation method, you will need:

- **PostgreSQL**: Version 14 or higher.
- **Redis**: For caching and session management.

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

Using Docker Compose is the easiest way to manage Drivebase. You can start it instantly with our automated installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://drivebase.io/install | bash
```

### Manual Compose Setup

If you prefer to manage the file locally:

1. **Download the Production Compose file**:
   ```bash
   # Using wget
   wget -O compose.yaml https://drivebase.io/compose

   # OR using curl
   curl -o compose.yaml https://drivebase.io/compose
   ```

2. **Configure your environment**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the same directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```
   Add your specific settings (see [Configuration](/docs/configuration)).

    <Callout>
      You can generate strong secrets for `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` using

      `openssl rand -base64 32`
    </Callout>

3. **Start the stack**:
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.local up -d
   ```

## From Source Code

If you want to run the latest code from the repository using Docker:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drivebase/drivebase.git
   cd drivebase
   ```

2. **Configure your environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your specific settings
   ```

3. **Build and start**:
   ```bash
   # This will build the image locally using the default compose.yaml
   docker compose --env-file .env.local up -d --build
   ```

## Local Development (with Bun)

If you want to contribute to Drivebase or run it manually for development:

1. **Install Bun**:
   Follow instructions at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run database migrations**:
   Make sure your PostgreSQL instance is running and configured in `.env.local`, then:
   ```bash
   bun run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
   This will start the API server and the frontend in development mode with hot-reloading.

## Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation:

- Ensure ports `3000` (App) and `4000` (API, if running separately) are not in use.
- Verify that PostgreSQL and Redis are accessible using the credentials provided in your `.env.local` file.
- Check the container logs: `docker compose logs -f`.
