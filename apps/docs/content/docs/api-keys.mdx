description: Programmatic access credentials for scripts and integrations

API keys let you authenticate against the Drivebase API without exposing your session credentials. They are long-lived, user-owned tokens with customizable scopes and an optional expiry date.

---

## Creating a key

Go to **Settings → API Keys** and click **New Key**. Give it a name, pick a scope, and optionally set an expiry date. The full key is shown **exactly once** — copy it before closing the dialog.

---

## Key format

Every API key starts with `drv_` followed by 40 hex characters:

```
drv_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

The first 12 characters (`drv_a1b2c3`) are stored as a display prefix so you can identify keys in the UI without exposing the secret.

---

## Authentication

Pass the key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header — the same header used for session JWTs:

```bash
curl https://your-drivebase.example.com/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer drv_a1b2c3d4..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ me { id email } }"}'
```

This works for both the GraphQL endpoint and the REST proxy endpoints (`/api/upload/proxy`, `/api/download/proxy`).

---

## Scopes

Scopes follow an additive hierarchy — each level includes everything below it.

| Scope   | Access |
|---------|--------|
| `read`  | List folders, browse and download files, list providers |
| `write` | Upload, delete, move, rename files (includes `read`) |
| `admin` | Workspace settings, provider management (includes `write`) |

A key with `write` scope can do everything a `read` key can, plus write operations. A key with `admin` scope has full access.

---

## Expiry

Keys can be set to expire at a specific date. Expired keys return a `401` immediately and cannot be reactivated — create a new key instead.

Keys without an expiry date are valid indefinitely until revoked.

---

## Revoking a key

Go to **Settings → API Keys**, click the trash icon next to the key, and confirm. Revocation is immediate and permanent — any requests using that key will return `401` straight away.

---

## Security notes

- Store keys in environment variables or a secrets manager, never in source code.
- Use the narrowest scope needed for the task.
- Set an expiry date for short-lived automation.
- Rotate keys regularly — revoke the old one after issuing a new one.
