description: Connect Dropbox accounts using OAuth 2.0
---

Drivebase integrates with Dropbox, allowing you to manage your Dropbox files alongside other storage providers.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting, you must create a Dropbox app in the Dropbox App Console to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials.

### 1. Create a Dropbox App

- Go to the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).
- Click **Create app**.
- Choose **Scoped access** as the API.
- Choose **Full Dropbox** for the access type (or **App folder** if you want to restrict Drivebase to a dedicated folder).
- Give your app a name (e.g. "Drivebase") and click **Create app**.

### 2. Configure Permissions

- Go to the **Permissions** tab of your app.
- Enable the following scopes:
  - `files.content.read` — Read files and folders.
  - `files.content.write` — Create, update, and delete files and folders.
  - `account_info.read` — Read account display name and email (used for the provider label in Drivebase).
- Click **Submit** to save the permissions.

### 3. Set the Redirect URI

- Go to the **Settings** tab.
- Under **OAuth 2 / Redirect URIs**, add your Drivebase callback URL:
  - Development: `http://localhost:4000/webhook/callback`
  - Production: `https://api.yourdomain.com/webhook/callback`
- Click **Add**.

### 4. Note Your Credentials

On the **Settings** tab, find your:
- **App key** — used as the Client ID.
- **App secret** — used as the Client Secret (click **Show** to reveal it).

## Connecting in Drivebase

1. Navigate to the **Providers** page in Drivebase.
2. Click **Connect Provider** and select **Dropbox**.
3. Enter your **App Key** and **App Secret**.
4. Click **Connect**. You will be redirected to a Dropbox authorization page.
5. Review the permissions and click **Allow**.

Once authorized, you will be redirected back to Drivebase and your Dropbox will be ready for use.

<Callout type="info">
Drivebase requests **offline access** during the OAuth flow so it can operate without requiring you to re-authorize. A refresh token is stored (encrypted) in the database and used to mint new access tokens automatically.
</Callout>

## Notes

- **File paths as identifiers**: Drivebase uses Dropbox path strings (e.g. `/drivebase/folder/file.txt`) as remote identifiers. All file operations go through Drivebase to keep paths consistent.
- **Upload method**: Uploads are streamed through the Drivebase API proxy (Dropbox does not support client-side presigned upload URLs).
- **Download method**: Downloads use Dropbox's temporary link API, providing a short-lived direct download URL.
- **Storage quota**: Drivebase reads your Dropbox space usage and displays it on the provider card.
