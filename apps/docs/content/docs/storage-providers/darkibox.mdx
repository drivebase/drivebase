description: Connect Darkibox accounts using an API key
---

Darkibox is a cloud file-hosting service. Drivebase connects to it using your personal API key to upload, download, organise, and stream files stored in your Darkibox account.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Log in to Darkibox
Go to [darkibox.com](https://darkibox.com) and sign in to your account.

### 2. Copy your API Key
Navigate to your account settings page. Your API key is listed there (e.g. `45whzlc91xqdmqm58`). Keep this value — you will paste it into Drivebase.

## Connecting in Drivebase

1. Navigate to the **Providers** page.
2. Click **Connect Provider** and select **Darkibox**.
3. Paste your API key into the **API Key** field.
4. Click **Connect**.

Drivebase will verify the key by calling the Darkibox account info endpoint and save your connection.

<Callout type="info">
Your API key is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM and never stored in plain text.
</Callout>

## Notes

- **Uploads** are proxied through the Drivebase server (no direct browser-to-Darkibox upload). Drivebase first fetches an upload server URL from Darkibox, then streams your file there as multipart form data.
- **Downloads** use a temporary direct link obtained from the Darkibox `file/direct_link` endpoint, bypassing the Drivebase server for better performance.
- **Folder copy** is not supported by the Darkibox API; only file copy (clone) is available.
- File remote IDs are the Darkibox `file_code` strings. Folder remote IDs are prefixed with `fld_` (e.g. `fld_12345`).
