description: Connect Nextcloud accounts using Login Flow v2
---

Connect your Nextcloud instance to Drivebase for unified file management. Authentication uses Nextcloud's Login Flow v2, which securely generates an app-specific password without exposing your real credentials.

## Prerequisites

You need a running Nextcloud instance (version 19 or later) with a user account.

No developer console setup or API key creation is required — Login Flow v2 handles everything automatically.

## Connecting in Drivebase

1. Navigate to the **Providers** page.
2. Click **Connect Provider** and select **Nextcloud**.
3. Enter your Nextcloud server URL (e.g., `https://cloud.example.com`).
4. Click **Connect** — your browser will open the Nextcloud login page.
5. Log in to your Nextcloud account and grant access.
6. Drivebase will automatically receive an app password and complete the connection.

<Callout type="info">
The app password is encrypted at rest in the Drivebase database. Your real Nextcloud password is never stored. You can revoke the app password from **Nextcloud Settings > Security > Devices & sessions** at any time.
</Callout>

## How It Works

- **Authentication**: Uses Nextcloud Login Flow v2, which creates a dedicated app password for Drivebase.
- **File Operations**: All uploads and downloads go through the Drivebase API proxy via WebDAV — there are no presigned URLs.
- **Chunked Uploads**: Large files use Nextcloud's chunked upload v2 protocol for reliable transfers.
- **Quota**: Storage quota is fetched via the WebDAV quota properties.
- **Account Info**: Display name and email are retrieved from the Nextcloud OCS API.

## Notes

- Files are identified by their WebDAV path (e.g., `/Drivebase/document.pdf`).
- Drivebase creates a `Drivebase` folder in your Nextcloud root to store managed files.
- Two-factor authentication is fully supported since Login Flow v2 handles auth through the browser.
