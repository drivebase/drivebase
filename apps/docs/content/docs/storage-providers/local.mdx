description: Configure local filesystem storage for Drivebase
---

Local storage allows you to use your server's disk space for file storage. This is the simplest way to get started and is ideal for single-server setups.

## Setup

When connecting a local storage provider, you need to provide the following configuration:

- **Root Path**: The absolute path on the server where Drivebase will store files (e.g., `/var/lib/drivebase/storage`).

### Permissions

The user running the Drivebase API process must have read and write permissions for the specified directory. If Drivebase cannot write to the path, uploads will fail.

```bash
# Example: Giving the current user ownership of the storage directory
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/lib/drivebase/storage
```

## Docker Configuration

If you are running Drivebase in Docker, the **Root Path** refers to the path **inside the container**. You must mount a host directory to that path using a volume to ensure your files persist when the container is restarted or updated.

### Example `compose.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:latest
    volumes:
      - /home/user/drivebase-data:/data/storage
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=...
```

In the Drivebase UI, you would then set the **Root Path** to `/data/storage`.

## Performance Considerations

Local storage performance depends on the underlying disk (HDD vs. SSD). For high-concurrency environments, ensure your disk I/O can handle the expected load.
