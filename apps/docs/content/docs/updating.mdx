title: Updating Drivebase
description: Keep your Drivebase installation up to date with the latest features and security patches
---

Drivebase regularly releases updates with new features, improvements, and security patches. This guide walks you through the update process and best practices.

## Update Notifications

Drivebase automatically checks for updates and notifies you when a new version is available. When logged in, you'll see an **"Update available"** indicator in the right panel below the version number. Click it to view the latest release notes on GitHub.

## Before You Update

<Callout type="warn" title="Important">
  Always backup your data before updating to a new version.
</Callout>

### Backup Your Database

Create a backup of your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker exec -t drivebase-postgres pg_dump -U postgres drivebase > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

If you're using a managed database service, use their backup tools instead.

### Review Release Notes

Before updating, always check the [release notes](https://github.com/drivebase/drivebase/releases) for:
- Breaking changes
- New features
- Required environment variable changes
- Special migration instructions

## Updating with Docker

The recommended way to update Drivebase is by pulling the latest Docker image.

### Step 1: Pull the Latest Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:latest
```

### Step 2: Stop the Current Container

If you're using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Or if running a standalone container:

```bash
docker stop drivebase
docker rm drivebase
```

### Step 3: Start with the New Image

Using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Or standalone:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name drivebase \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." \
  -e JWT_SECRET="your-secret" \
  -v drivebase-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:latest
```

Make sure to use the same environment variables and volume mounts as before.

### Step 4: Verify the Update

1. **Check the logs** to ensure the application started successfully:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

2. **Database migrations** run automatically on startup. Look for migration success messages in the logs.

3. **Log in** to the web interface and verify the new version number in the right panel.

## Version Pinning (Recommended for Production)

Instead of using `latest`, pin to specific versions in production environments:

```yaml {3}
services:
  drivebase:
    image: ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:v1.2.0
    # ... rest of configuration
```

This approach:
- Prevents unexpected updates
- Gives you control over when to upgrade
- Makes deployments predictable and repeatable

To update:
1. Change the version tag in your `compose.yaml`
2. Run `docker compose up -d`

## Rolling Back

If you encounter issues after updating:

### Step 1: Stop the New Version

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Step 2: Pull the Previous Version

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:v1.0.0
```

### Step 3: Update Your Configuration

In your `docker-compose.yml`, change the image tag:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:v1.0.0
```

### Step 4: Restore Database (if needed)

If the update included database migrations that caused issues:

```bash
docker exec -i drivebase-postgres psql -U postgres drivebase < backup-20260215.sql
```

### Step 5: Start the Previous Version

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Update Best Practices

- **Test in staging**: If possible, test updates in a staging environment before production
- **Schedule maintenance windows**: Update during low-traffic periods
- **Monitor after updates**: Watch logs and metrics for 24-48 hours after updating
- **Keep backups**: Maintain at least 3 recent database backups
- **Document your setup**: Keep notes on your specific configuration for easier troubleshooting

## Checking Your Current Version

You can check your current Drivebase version in several ways:

### In the Web Interface

Log in and look at the right panel. Your version is displayed below your email address.

### Using Docker

```bash
docker exec drivebase bun --version
```

### Via API

Query the metadata endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.com/graphql \
  -d '{"query":"query { appMetadata { version } }"}'
```

## Troubleshooting Updates

### Update Fails to Start

1. Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure database is accessible
4. Check disk space: `docker system df`

### Database Migration Errors

If migrations fail:

1. Check the logs for specific error messages
2. Verify database user has required permissions
3. Restore from backup and retry
4. Check the GitHub issues for known migration problems

### Version Mismatch Warnings

If you see version mismatch warnings:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Do a hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Ensure all services are running the same version
