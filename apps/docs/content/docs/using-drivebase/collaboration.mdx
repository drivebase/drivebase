description: Manage workspace members, roles, and invite links in Drivebase.

Drivebase collaboration is workspace-based. Members are added to a workspace with a role, and that role controls what they can do.

## Workspace Roles

Drivebase supports four workspace roles:

- **Owner**
- **Admin**
- **Editor**
- **Viewer**

Current permission behavior:

- **Owner/Admin**: can manage workspace members and providers.
- **Owner/Admin/Editor**: can create, update, and delete files.
- **Viewer**: read-only access to files.

## Inviting Teammates

In **Settings → Users**, owners and admins can generate invite links with:

- A preset role (`admin`, `editor`, or `viewer`).
- An expiration window.

Invite rules enforced by the backend:

- `owner` cannot be assigned through invites.
- Invite expiration must be between **1 and 30 days**.
- Invite links can be accepted once and can be revoked.

## Managing Members

In the same **Users** settings section, owners and admins can:

- View all workspace members.
- Change member roles (except the owner role).
- Remove members from the workspace.

When an invite is accepted, Drivebase creates or updates that user’s workspace membership for the target workspace.

## Collaboration Data Model

Collaboration state is stored with:

- `workspace_memberships`: links users to workspaces with a role.
- `workspace_invites`: invite token, role, inviter, expiration, and acceptance/revocation state.

Each user can have only one membership per workspace (`workspace_id + user_id` is unique).
