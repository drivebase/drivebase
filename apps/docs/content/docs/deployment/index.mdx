description: Production deployment guidance and best practices for Drivebase
---

Deploying Drivebase to production requires careful consideration of security, performance, and reliability. This guide provides a checklist and best practices for a successful deployment.

## Production Checklist

Before going live, ensure you have addressed the following:

- **Secure Keys**: Change `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to strong, random values.
- **Database Backups**: Implement a regular backup strategy for your PostgreSQL database.
- **SSL/TLS**: Always serve Drivebase over HTTPS.
- **CORS Settings**: Restrict `CORS_ORIGIN` to your actual frontend domain.
- **Logs**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` to ensure structured JSON logging.

## Docker Deployment (GHCR)

The recommended way to deploy is using our pre-built Docker image. It includes both the API and the web frontend served by Caddy.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/drivebase/drivebase:latest
```

When running the container, ensure you pass all required production environment variables.

## Reverse Proxy Setup

Drivebase's Docker image includes an internal Caddy server, but you might want to run it behind another reverse proxy like Nginx or a global Caddy instance for SSL management.

### Example Nginx Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name drivebase.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Increase max body size for large file uploads
        client_max_body_size 10G;
    }
}
```

## Storage Considerations

- **Local Storage**: If using the local provider, ensure the storage volume is backed up and has sufficient IOPS.
- **S3/Object Storage**: Use IAM roles or restricted access keys with the minimum necessary permissions (limited to specific buckets).

## Updating Drivebase

To keep your Drivebase installation up to date with the latest features and security patches, see the [Updating guide](/docs/updating).
