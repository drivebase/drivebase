description: Introduction to Drivebase GraphQL API
---

Drivebase exposes a comprehensive GraphQL API for managing files, folders, users, and storage providers.

## Base URL

The API is served at the `/graphql` endpoint.

```
POST http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

## Authentication

Most API operations require authentication. You must include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

You can obtain a token via the `login` or `register` mutations.

## Global Errors

The API returns standard GraphQL errors. Common error codes include:

- `UNAUTHENTICATED`: Missing or invalid token.
- `FORBIDDEN`: User does not have permission.
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found.
- `BAD_USER_INPUT`: Invalid arguments.

## schema

You can inspect the full schema by sending an introspection query to the GraphQL endpoint.

## Other Endpoints

Besides GraphQL, a few REST endpoints are available for specific use cases:

- **OAuth Callback**: `GET /webhook/callback` - Used internally for storage provider OAuth flows.
- **Proxy Upload**: `POST /api/upload/proxy` - Direct file upload to storage providers via the API server.
- **Proxy Download**: `GET /api/download/proxy` - Direct file download from storage providers via the API server.
